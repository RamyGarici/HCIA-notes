## 1.3.2 Introduction to ISO 27001 Information Security Management System

### Definition of ISMS

An ISMS is a system in which an organization establishes information security policies and objectives and uses management methods to achieve them.
It originated from the BS 7799 standard of the British Standards Institution.

---

### PDCA Model

- Plan: Establish the ISMS
- Do: Implement and operate the ISMS
- Check: Monitor and review the ISMS
- Act: Improve the ISMS

---

### ISO/IEC 27000 Evolution

BS 7799 was adopted by ISO and became ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 (released in 2013).

---

### ISMS Content (ISO/IEC 27002 – 14 Domains)

Information security policy, organization of information security, human resource security, asset management,
access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security, operations security, communications security,
system acquisition development and maintenance, supplier relationships, information security incident management,
business continuity management, compliance.

### ISO/IEC 27001 Implementation (PDCA)

PLAN: Project initiation, gap analysis, policy design  
DO: Risk assessment, system design, ISMS implementation and training  
CHECK: Monitoring, auditing, business continuity testing  
ACT: Certification, management review, continuous improvement
