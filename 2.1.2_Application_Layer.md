# 2.1.2 Application Layer

## Overview

The **Application Layer** provides interfaces for application software so that applications can use network services.  
Based on the underlying **transport-layer protocol**, applications define the **port number** used at the transport layer.

## Typical Application Layer Protocols

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP is used to transfer files from one host to another, enabling **file upload and download**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Uses a **client-server architecture**
- Establishes two connections between client and server:
  - **Control connection**
  - **Data connection**
- Supports two operating modes:
  - **Active (Proactive) Mode**: Data connection is initiated by the **server**
  - **Passive Mode**: Data connection is initiated by the **client**
- **Active mode** is used by default, but users can switch to **passive mode** if needed

### SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

SFTP is a secure file transfer protocol based on **SSH**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Encrypts both **authentication information** and **data**
- Provides higher security than FTP
- Uses a **single communication channel**
- Default destination port: **22**
- Client and server are securely connected via SSH
- Unlike FTP, SFTP does **not** use separate control and data channels

### Telnet

Telnet is a standard protocol that provides **remote login services** over a network.

**Key characteristics:**
- Allows users to operate remote devices from a local PC
- Users log in to a remote device using a **Telnet client**
- Commands entered on the client are executed on the server
- Transmits data in **plaintext** (not secure)

---

### Stelnet (Secure Telnet)

Stelnet is a secure version of Telnet, implemented based on **SSH**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Encrypts all transmitted data
- Provides secure remote login services
- Default destination port: **22**
- More secure than Telnet

**Stelnet communication phases:**
1. Version negotiation
2. Algorithm negotiation
3. Key exchange
4. User authentication
5. Session interaction

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is one of the most widely used protocols on the Internet.

**Key characteristics:**
- Designed for publishing and retrieving **HTML pages**
- Uses a client-server model
- Default port: **80**
- Data is transmitted in plaintext

---

### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP.

**Key characteristics:**
- Based on HTTP with **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** added
- Provides:
  - Identity authentication
  - Data encryption
  - Data integrity verification
- Default port: **443**
- Most modern websites use HTTPS for secure communication

---

### DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is used to map **domain names** to **IP addresses**.

**Why DNS is needed:**
- Users access websites using domain names
- Computers require IP addresses to communicate

**Types of domain name resolution:**
- **Static domain name resolution**
  - Uses locally stored mappings
  - Attempted first
- **Dynamic domain name resolution**
  - Queries DNS servers
  - Used if static resolution fails
