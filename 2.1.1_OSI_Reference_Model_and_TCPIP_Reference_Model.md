# 2.1.1 OSI Reference Model and TCP/IP Reference Model

## General Overview

Applications are developed to meet various user requirements (web pages, online gaming, etc.).  
Information is generated by applications in the form of data (text, images, videos, etc.).

From a network engineer’s perspective, applications generate **data**, and data is the carrier of all kinds of information.  
Most application-generated data needs to be transmitted between devices. Therefore, network engineers focus mainly on the **end-to-end data transmission process**.

## OSI Reference Model

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** is a **7-layer architecture** proposed by the **ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** in **1984**.

### OSI Layers

1. **Application Layer**
   - Provides network services and interfaces for applications.

2. **Presentation Layer**
   - Translates data formats.
   - Ensures that application-layer data from one system can be correctly identified and understood by another system.

3. **Session Layer**
   - Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between communicating parties.

4. **Transport Layer**
   - Establishes, maintains, and terminates end-to-end data transmission.
   - Responsible for reliability and flow control.

5. **Network Layer**
   - Defines logical addressing.
   - Transfers data from source to destination across networks.

6. **Data Link Layer**
   - Encapsulates packets into frames.
   - Transfers frames in point-to-point or point-to-multipoint mode.
   - Implements error detection.

7. **Physical Layer**
   - Transmits raw bit streams over the transmission medium.
   - Defines electrical, mechanical, and physical specifications.

## TCP/IP Reference Model

The OSI model is considered complex, while **TCP/IP** is widely used in the industry.  
TCP/IP has become the **actual reference model of the Internet**.

### TCP/IP Layers

1. **Application Layer**
2. **Transport (Host-to-Host) Layer**
3. **Network (Internet) Layer**
4. **Network Interface Layer**
   - Includes:
     - Data Link Layer
     - Physical Layer
