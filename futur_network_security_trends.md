## 1.2 Future Network Security Trends

### Top 8 Security and Risk Trends

1. **Cybersecurity Mesh**  
   A modern security architecture approach enabling distributed enterprises to deploy security where it is most needed.

2. **Cyber-Savvy Boards**  
   Enterprises are forming dedicated cybersecurity committees led by board members with security expertise.

3. **Vendor Consolidation**  
   Integrated security products improve operational efficiency and reduce enterprise costs.

4. **Identity-First Security**  
   As attackers focus on identity and access management, identity-first security becomes critical.

5. **Managing Identities as a Critical Capability**  
   The growth of non-human identities has made identity management a vital security operation.

6. **Remote Work Is Now Just “Work”**  
   Enterprises must redesign security policies and tools to mitigate risks associated with long-term remote work.

7. **Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)**  
   Tools that help enterprises validate their security posture and improve defense capabilities.

8. **Privacy-Enhancing Computation Techniques**  
   Technologies that enable secure data processing, sharing, and analytics, even in untrusted environments.

## Network Security Situational Awareness (NSSA)

Network Security Situational Awareness (NSSA) is the real-time understanding of a network’s security state.

### Stages:
- **Perception**: Collecting security data
- **Comprehension**: Understanding whether activity is malicious
- **Projection**: Predicting future impacts

Traditional isolated security detection cannot effectively address advanced threats such as APTs.

### NSSA Functions:
- Security data processing
- Security element collection
- Security data analysis
- Result visualization

### Example: HiSec (Huawei Security Solution)

HiSec collects traffic and device logs across enterprise networks.  
Using machine learning, threat intelligence, and big data analysis, it detects potential and advanced threats and presents results via a graphical user interface.

## Zero Trust Security

Zero Trust Security shifts defense from network boundaries to users, devices, and resources.

### Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

ZTA aims to:
- Prevent data disclosure
- Restrict lateral movement attacks

### Core Principles:
- No implicit trust for any user or device
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Strict access control

**Core concept**:  
Never trust, always verify.
