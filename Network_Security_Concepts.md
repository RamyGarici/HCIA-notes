  - Integrity  
  - Availability

#### Evolution of Network Security

Network security has continuously evolved over time:

- **1940s – Communication Security Period**  
  - Security was underdeveloped and data was scattered  
  - Great importance was attached to information security  
  - Mainly based on **cryptography (ciphers)**

- **1970s–1980s – Information Security Period**  
  - Network technologies entered the practical stage  
  - Strong emphasis on the **CIA triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

- **1990s – Information Assurance Period**  
  - New security principles were introduced:
    - **Controllability**
    - **Non-repudiation**
  - Security objectives expanded to **CIA + controllability + non-repudiation**

- **Today – Cyberspace Security Period**  
  - The connotation and scope of information security have expanded into **cyberspace security**
  - Security now covers the **entire cyberspace**, including:
    - Data
    - Users
    - Operations
    - Facilities and infrastructure
  - National standards and regulations (e.g., cybersecurity classified protection) guide enterprises in establishing **information security management systems**
